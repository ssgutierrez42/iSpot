In order to build this project, first successfully run an iOS sample project from [Tensorflow on Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples). Then drop the iSpot repository into the same directory (hundreds of dependent files are relative to that location).
