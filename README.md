# iSpot

Dogspotting game that features offline dog breed detection. It was built for Stanford's CS193P. 

The full iSpot repository is not available to the public. 
This repo includes the Tensorflow add-on files for the full project.
You must replace/add the files listed here to the rest of the (private) code.

In order to build this project, first follow all instructions here to successfully run an iOS sample project: [Tensorflow on Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/ios_examples). Then drop the iSpot repository into the same directory (hundreds of dependent files are relative to that location).
Finally, replace the original project files with these.
